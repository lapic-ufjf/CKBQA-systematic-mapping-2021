Para isso, eles usam o e WikiAnswers paraphrasing templates dataset, que já contém 5 milhões de templates. Porém, como o dataset é cheio de ruídos eles criaram uma regressa de associação entre os templates do dataset para verificar se os templates estão corretos ou não. (2) Question Parsing: onde são criadas as n-tuplas lógicas na query da etapa anterior usando análise de denpendencia. Nessa etapa eles usam árvore de dependência e analisam a relação entre as entidades da frase para criar as tuplas. (3) Open KB Querying: Etapa em que eles testam cada tupla dentro do KG para gerar uma lista de respostas candidatas. Nesse processos, eles utilizam um conjunto de assertions indexadas no SOLR e, na proxima etapa, fazem um alinhamento entre tupla e o KG para encontrar os relacionamentos (Usam POStag e outros NLP tools para isso) (4) Answer Ranking: Validamento e ranqueamento dos candidatos a resposta. Para isso usam um conjunto de análises de similaridade, n_gran e frequencia das entidades em cada resposta. Por último, fazendo um log-linear para calcular a probabilidade da resposta correta ser aquela.

Freebase	F1, Precision	ComplexWebQuestions	We propose to decompose complex questions into a sequence of simple questions, and compute the final answer from the sequence of answers. To illustrate the viability of our approach, we create a new dataset of complex questions, COMPLEXWEBQUESTIONS, and present a model that decomposes questions and interacts with the web to compute an answer.	Our goal is to learn a model that given a question q and a black box QA model for answering simple questions, SIMPQA(·), produces a computation tree t that decomposes the question and computes the answer. The model is trained from a set of N question-computation tree pairs or question-answer pairs.

COMPLEXWEBQUESTIONSand find that question decomposition substantially improves precision@1 from 20.8 to 27.5. We find that humans are able to reach 63.0 precision@1 under a limited time budget, leaving ample room for improvement in future work. In future work, we plan to develop a more general representation, which will require training from denotations

The reasoning network has three modules: input module, reasoning module, and answer module. The input module encodes a question to a vector representation and updates the representation of the question at each hop of the reasoning process. The reasoning module aims to attend to a particular part of the question at each hop, predict an associated relation in knowledge base, and then update its state. The answer module chooses the corresponding entity from KB at each hop. At the last hop, the selected entity is chosen as the final answer.	IRN	General	X

To find answers in the quasi KG, we first identify pivotal nodes that we call cornerstones: every node that matches a word or phrase in the question, with similarity above a threshold, becomes a cornerstone. Also, relation nodes and type nodes become cornerstones. All cornerstone nodes for our running example question have thick borders. These nodes are weighted based on the matching or similarity scores. The key idea for identifying answer candidates is that these nodes should be tightly connected to many cornerstones. To formalize this intuition, we consider three factors: (i) answers lie on paths connecting cornerstones, (ii) short paths are preferred, and (iii) paths with higher weights are better	QUEST processes questions in two phases: on-the-fly construction of the quasi KG for the question, and, the graph algorithm for computing ranked answers. Together, these phases comprise the following five steps: (1a) Retrieving question-relevant documents from an open corpus (e.g., the entire Web), (1b) Extracting proximity-based SPO triples from these documents using Open IE techniques, (1c) Building a noisy quasi KG from these triples, (2a) Computing GSTs on the quasi KG to derive candidate answers, (2b) Filtering and scoring candidates to produce ranked answers	CN  Foco :  Perguntas com multiplos predicados/fatos	General	http://qa.mpi-inf.mpg.de/quest/.

It is designed to handle questions where the answer is a  subset of entities or an aggregate based on this subset, e.g., questions for which the expected answer is a subset of properties in the graph, are currently out of scope. An important next step is to use QAmp to improve the recall of the benchmark dataset by complementing the answer set with missing answers derived from relaxing the dataset  ssumptions. Recognizing relation directionality is an important direction for future work, which requires extending existing benchmark datasets and the addition of more cases  here an explicit order is required to retrieve correct answers. Another direction is to  mprove predicate matching, which is the weakest component of the proposed approach as identified in our ablation study. Finally, unsupervised message passing can be  dopted for other tasks that require uncertain reasoning on KGs, such as knowledge base completion, text entailment, summarization, and dialogue response generation

In this model, multi-relation question answering is formulated as a sequential decision problem. Given a natural language question, SRN learns a policy which starts from the topic entity, and performs effective path search over the KG to obtain the answer. Specifically, conditioned on the question and previous decisions, SRN leverages beam search to take a list of triples at each step	S	Tem o pseudo código dentro do artigo, porém não faz referencias a git nem nada	Freebase	Hit	PathQuestion, WolrdCup2014, METAQA  	They break down into simple questions and set up a path to the answer. The process called Markov decision process is used. There is an agent, an environment and a reward for every interaction that is made. This is all done using reinforced learning within a knowledge graph	Entity Linker para achar a entidade alvo, aplica um word embeddings na pergunta, depois usa uma Bi-GRU para criar os vetores das questoes,  passa por um Single-Layer Perceptron ,  depois por uma camada de ativação, outro percpetron e então pela softmax para responder a pergunta	Foco: Perguntas com multiplos predicados/fatos	MultiPredicade	https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04726.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.04071.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02266   	Following some existing embedding-based methods, SRN employs  multi-hop reasoning to answer multi-relation questions. From a  certain point of view, multi-hop reasoning is similar to semantic  parsing, since both of them are focus on detecting correct paths from  topic entities to answer nodes, and the paths generated by multihop reasoning can also form logic forms. However, when faced with  more complex questions like “Which player is the highest in NBA?”,  multi-hop reasoning cannot handle them very well, because there  exist constraints requiring to be attached to the paths between topic  entities and candidate answers.

Then, in the online stage, each entity/relation phrase of the given NLQ is mapped to a set of candidate matching vertices/edges of the underlying KG. With the embedding vectors learned in the offline stage, the mapping results are utilized to compute the structure of the target query. Finally, we select the most suitable matching vertices/edges and assemble them into the target query according to the computed query structure		General		Since the main failure cause of our framework is the errors during phrase mapping, we intend to explore more effective phrase mapping methods in the future. And, we are trying to improve the performance of our embedding method by adopting improved translation mechanisms.
